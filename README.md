# ðŸ©º ML Project: Predicting Health Insurance Charges (MediBuddy Capstone)

The goal of this project is to build a predictive machine learning model that estimates **health insurance charges** based on user demographics and lifestyle features.

In addition to model building, extensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and visual reporting have been done to understand cost-driving factors. The model helps forecast costs, optimize pricing, and guide policy decisions.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

The healthcare and insurance industry needs a reliable way to **predict medical insurance costs**. Accurate cost prediction helps:

- Insurance companies in premium setting and customer segmentation  
- Customers understand the factors affecting their premium  
- To enhance personalization in its service offerings  

We aim to build a machine learning model to predict `charges in INR` using features such as:

- Age  
- Sex  
- BMI  
- Number of Children  
- Smoking Status  
- Region  
- BMI Category  
- Age Group

## ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Before building the model, we conducted a thorough EDA using **Excel** and **Python**, which included:

- Distribution of charges across age groups and BMI categories  
- Relationship between smoking habits and costs  
- Average charges per region and sex
